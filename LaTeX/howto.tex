\section{What is \LaTeX?}
\begin{itemize}
\item Used in textbooks, journal/conference articles, and lab reports!
\item You provide the material and \LaTeX\ renders according to typographical conventions \&c.
\item Not a WYSIWYG editor!
\item Initial release 1985 by Leslie Lamport -- \underline{La}mport \TeX. \TeX\ originally from Donald Knuth in 1978.\footnote{Knuth says to pronounce his name ``Ka-NOOTH''. See {\tt{}http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/\textasciitilde{}uno/faq.html}}
\item \TeX\ is an abbreviation of \texttau\'\!\!\!\textepsilon\textchi\textnu\texteta \; or ``art craft''. Thus, it should be pronounced as ``tech'' in \emph{technical}. %\tau\epsilon\chi\nu\eta
\end{itemize}

\section{\LaTeX\ rendering tools}
\begin{itemize}
\item In ye olde days, used the {\tt tex} command from the command line -- produced postscript {\tt .ps} file. Now straight to {\tt .pdf} with many tools!
\item OSX
\begin{itemize}
\item TeXworks
\item MacTeX
\end{itemize}
\item Windows
\begin{itemize}
\item MiKTeX
\end{itemize}
\item Linux
\begin{itemize}
\item Google is your friend! Personally I use {\tt vim} with {\tt pdflatex}.
\end{itemize}
\item Alternatively, use an online service like
\begin{itemize}
\item https://www.overleaf.com/
\item https://www.sharelatex.com/
\end{itemize}
Some services might even allow you to collaborate (useful for partner lab reports!)
\end{itemize}

\section{Document structure}
\LaTeX\ expects a specific structure to your document. Generally, the document is in two parts, a \textbf{preamble} and a \textbf{body}. In the preamble, you tell the renderer what sort of document this is (books look different than journal articles), along with what extra \emph{package}s to include, e.g., Greek or special math characters. The ``meat'' of your document---everything that you want to actually show up---goes in the body.

Here's an example document:

\begin{addmargin}[1em]{0em}
\begin{verbatim}
\documentclass[12pt]{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage{amssymb}

\begin{document}
\section{Section the First}
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, quo autem fugit vivendum eu, mel at 
lorem homero hendrerit
\end{document}
\end{verbatim}
\end{addmargin}

The first line tells the renderer to treat the document as an \emph{article} and to normalize to 12 pt font. The next two lines are my personal ``always-use'' packages. They provide various math symbols and environments that I find interminably useful.

The rest of the document lies with the {\tt document} environment, enclosed by the {\tt \tbs begin\{$\cdot$\}} and {\tt \tbs end\{$\cdot$\}} tags. [TODO: talk about section/subsection/etc.]

\section{Styling}
In general, you try to avoid explicitly styling your document as much as possible. The renderer almost definitely knows better than you. Styling font, e.g., adding emphasis, is fine though.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l l}
Product & Code \\
\hline
\emph{Your text here!} & {\tt \tbs{}emph\{Your text here!\}} \\
\textbf{Your text here!} & {\tt \tbs{}textbf\{Your text here!\}} \\
\underline{Your text here!} & {\tt \tbs{}underline\{Your text here!\}}
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

When it's \textbf{\emph{absolutely}} necessary, you can add spaces, carriage returns, and page breaks
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l l}
Effect & Code \\
\hline
Narrow space & {\tt \tbs{},} \\
Em-width space & {\tt \tbs } \;\;followed by space \\
Wide space & {\tt \tbs{};} \\
``Backwards'' space & {\tt \tbs{}! }\\
Single line break / carriage return & {\tt \tbs\tbs} \\
Four-line break & {\tt \tbs{}vspace\{4em\}} \\
Page break & {\tt \tbs{}vfill} \\
Fill extra horizontal space & {\tt \tbs{}hfill}
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

You've noticed by now that commands seem to be preceded by the backslash {\tt \tbs} character.\footnote{It's a backslash, not a forward slash. You recognize this by the fact that it's a vertical line falling backwards. URLs on the internet make use of \emph{forward} slashes!} The backslash is called an \emph{escape} character. Using it lets the compiler know that it should treat the following characters a part of a command as opposed to normal text. 


\section{Math mode}
[TODO] words about math mode. Inline vs environments
\begin{itemize}
\item \tbs{}usepackage\{amsmath\}
\item \tbs{}usepackage\{amssymb\}
\item superscript / subscript
\item \tbs{}sqrt
\item \tbs{}int
\item special sequences \\sin
\item fractions (frac and dfrac)
\item \tbs{}mathrm 
\item \tbs{}mathbb
\item \tbs{}mathcal
\item putting spaces in math mode
\item  - align
\item - array
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Well wishes}
There's a lot to learn; don't be discouraged! You only need to remember a very small subset of everything in order to produce beautiful documents. Keep templates of useful document classes, look things up (@ Google ``{\tt{}How do I do} X {\tt{}in LaTeX}''), and ask questions when necessary. Learning to write with \LaTeX\ is learning use a new skill. Keep at it and you'll be an expert in no time!
